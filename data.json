      "INGREDIENTS:
        Chicken, cut into serving pieces -- 1 (3-pound)
        Dried sumac (see variations) -- 1/4 cup
        Ground cinnamon -- 1 teaspoon
        Ground allspice or cloves -- 1/2 teaspoon
        Ground nutmeg -- 1/4 teaspoon
        Salt and pepper -- to season
        Olive oil -- 1/4 cup
        Onions, thinly sliced -- 3
        Lavash bread -- 2 large pieces

      DIRECTIONS:
        In a large bowl, mix together the chicken, sumac, spices, salt and pepper. Refrigerate and let marinate for at least 30 minutes, or preferably for several hours.
        Preheat oven to 350°F. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high flame. Add the chicken, a few pieces at a time, and brown on both sides. Remove to a plate and set aside.
        Add the onions to the skillet and saute, stirring often, until the onions are cooked down and beginning to brown, 15 to 25 minutes.
        Line the bottom of a baking dish large enough to hold the chicken and onions with a sheet of lavash bread. Spread half the onions over the bread, then place chicken over the onions. Top the chicken with the remaining onions. Cover the whole dish with the remaining sheet of lavash bread, tucking in the sides to seal the chicken in. Sprinkle the lavash bread with water to lightly moisten it.
        Place the baking dish in the oven and bake for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until the chicken is cooked through (an insta-read thermometer inserted into the dish should register around 180°F). If the bread starts to burn, cover it lightly with aluminum foil.
        Remove the dish from the oven and let it rest about 10 minutes. Remove and discard the top bread and serve the chicken in its dish.",
